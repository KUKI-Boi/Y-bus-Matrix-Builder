# Y-bus-Matrix-Builder
An interactive MATLAB program to construct the Bus Admittance Matrix (Y-Bus) for power system networks. This tool allows users to input transmission line data in either Impedance (R, X) or Admittance (G, B) format and automatically generates the Y-Bus matrix with optional shunt admittances.
